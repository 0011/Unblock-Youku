# Unblock Youku

This project contains three-fold functionalities.

1. _A Google Chrome extension_ for smoothly surfing on many websites blocking visitors outside mainland China.
   
   You can find this extension on Chrome Web Store at [http://bit.ly/unblock-youku](http://bit.ly/unblock-youku)

2. _A local proxy server_ based on the non-blocking [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) for bypassing the mainland restriction _for other browsers such as Firefox and Safari_ (but not guaranteed).

   1. Run the proxy script locally: ```node server.js```
    
   2. Set (only) the HTTP proxy of your browser to ```127.0.0.1:8080```
    
   For more instructions, please see [these examples](http://bit.ly/unblock-youku-proxy).

3. _A backend server_ to support the redirection mode of the Chrome extension.
